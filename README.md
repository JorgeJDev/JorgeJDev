## About Me âœ¨

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm Jorge Juan from Spain. I recently completed a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp where I learned to build various applications, primarily using the MERN stack.

ðŸŒ± I'm eager to continue learning and seeking opportunities to showcase the skills I've acquired during this period.
